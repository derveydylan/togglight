        <strong>Togglight</strong> is a puzzle game where you toggle lights (that are on a grid) between off and on states. <br>
        When switching a light state, it reverses the neighboring lights states too, in a plus shape (+). <br>
        A puzzle is resolved when all lights are off.
    </p>

    <p>Unlike other Lights Out games, the grid can contain cells without lights.<p>
